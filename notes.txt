1. Src contents list:
    - component (All components that we use in this project, Card and MatchCarousel)
    - services (Middleware for frontend where we make calls to our apis)
    - App .tsx, .css, .test.tsx (Main files for main component, design and tests)
    - Other files created by default

2. package.json - no added modules

3. Potential improvements
    - I used nested for loops for extracting data from about matches and teams,
    I know that it is not the most professional way to nest so many loops, but in 
    this case it looked easiest and most secure way instead of using some filter or map,
    or some npm module.

    - I couldn't get teams/players logos from url that your example provided,
    'http://ls.betradar.com/ls/crest/big/<team_id>.png' - I got error that its
    not accessible, so I have used country codes to get their flags and for players
    I put default pictures that state that image is not available.
